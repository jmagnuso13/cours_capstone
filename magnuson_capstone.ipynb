    "## Final Project Overview\n",
    "### Opportunity Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Covid pandemic resulted in a greatly renewed interest in nature & outdoor activities, due to safety issues and restrictions placed on typical indoor attractions in urban areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Trends data below shows the enormous spike in searches for \"Outdoor Activities\" in the US in 2020 compared to the preceeding 5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Images/trendsplot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While one can assume some return closer to pre-pandemic baselines once the pandemic is addressed, interest in outdoor-oriented vacations/remote work can reasonably be expected to remain at a higher level than they were pre-pandemic, leading to continued opportunity in vacation rental housing in these markets with an abundance of options. This is likely to be complimented by the increasing acceptance of remote work, given office closures throughout 2020, potentially creating a larger market for work/leisure travel, increasing the potential weeks Americans could travel without requiring vacation days. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will attempt to assist an investor attempting to take advantage of this renewed interest in outdoor experience, by identifying smaller rural cities and towns with an abundance of outdoor activity and stable housing values to investigate an investment in a vacation rental home to list on the prominent rental platforms (Airbnb/VRBO/etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "My datasets will leverage the [Foursquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/) to identify outdoor places and the [Zillow Home Values Forecast (City Admin Level)](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) to identify home value trends in these areas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I will then cluster the data using K-Means Clustering to identify ideal markets for a potential investment into a vacation rental home.  The goal is to identify clusters of potentially undervalued markets from a housing investment perspective to identify cities with future growth potential for a housing investment.  "

    "### Discussion\n",
    "The problem I attempted to solve was to identify potentially undervalued cities for real estate investment to take advantage of the increased interest in outdoor recreation resulting from COVID.  By focusing on Colorado, I can analyze a fast-growing state with an abundance of small/medium-sized cities near nature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The work done thus far already highlighted a set of target cities that may be worthy of investment now. Of course, the work done to cluster thus far is really still in the beginning stage of analysis.  Having gotten to this point, there are a number of paths I would like to take to improve this further which I will discuss in the next section. \n",

    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I narrowed down cities for a potential vacation housing investment by clustering cities by the distribution of their outdoor amenties.  While I believe I have satisfied the requirements for the project, there are a number of additional steps I would like to take to further drill into optimal cities for such an investment. \n",
